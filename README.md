# GiftList

Work in progress

Frontend : NuxtJS, @nuxtjs/auth, @nuxtjs/axios

Backend : Express API, Firebase Authentication and Database

 
## 🎁 Wishlist application

GiftList is a web application allowing you to create your wishlists for special events such as birthdays, weddings, births or simply a bucket list.


## 🔗 Share it with your loved ones

You'll then be able to share your list with your friends and family. 


## 🔏 Choose what to offer 

Everyone having the share link will be able to mark what they plan to offer/buy.


## ❌ No more duplicate gifts

That way, the other offering people will know what's available and what's not, in order to avoid duplicates gifts.


## 🙈 Keep the element of surprise

Of course, the list owner won't be able to see what people intend to offer him.

## How can I discover the running app

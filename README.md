# GiftList

Work in progress

NuxtJS SSR application using:

-   @nuxtjs/auth for client Authentication
-   @nuxtjs/axios for API requests
-   Express for the API as a server middleware
-   Firebase Authentication for backend user handling
-   Firebase Database

### 🎁 Wishlist application

GiftList is a web application allowing you to create your wishlists for special events such as birthdays, weddings, births or simply a bucket list.

### 🔗 Share it with your loved ones

You'll then be able to share your list with your friends and family.

### 🔏 Choose what to offer

Everyone having the share link will be able to mark what they plan to offer/buy.

### ❌ No more duplicate gifts

That way, the other offering people will know what's available and what's not, in order to avoid duplicates gifts.

### 🙈 Keep the element of surprise

Of course, the list owner won't be able to see what people intend to offer him.

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app in development mode
$ npm run dev

# Build the app for production
$ npm run build

# Run the app after production is done
$ npm run start
```
